# PART A: ESSENTIAL PRE-CLASS (30 minutes)
## ⏱️ Quick Foundation Before You Walk Into Class

**Goal:** Arrive at class with core vocabulary and concepts. No deep dives—just enough to understand WHY design matters.

## A.1: The Three Pillars of Visualization (10 mins)

### 🧠 Pillar 1: PERCEPTION (How Humans See)

**Key Concept: Pre-attentive Processing**
- Your brain processes important visual elements in **200-500 milliseconds** (before you consciously "look")
- Important insights should **jump out** without effort
- Example: A red bar among gray bars catches your eye instantly

**Key Concept: Cognitive Load**
- Working memory can only hold **4-7 items** at once
- Remove clutter; highlight only what matters
- Result: Viewers understand faster with less frustration

**Action for Class:** Notice how instructors remove gridlines, limit colors, and organize subplots. That's cognitive load management.

### 🎨 Pillar 2: DESIGN (How to Show Data Honestly)

**Chart Selection Rule:**
| Goal | Chart | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Compare categories | Bar chart | Lengths are easy to compare |
| Show trends over time | Line chart | Continuity shows flow |
| Show correlation | Scatter plot | Position reveals relationships |
| Show distribution | Box/Violin plot | Reveals median, quartiles, outliers |

**The Golden Rule of Honest Visualization:**
❌ **NEVER:** Truncate bar chart axes (start anywhere but 0)  
✅ **ALWAYS:** Bar charts must start at 0 for accurate magnitude comparison

**Why?** Truncating distorts relative sizes and misleads viewers.

### 📖 Pillar 3: STORYTELLING (How to Communicate)

**Three-Act Structure:**
```
ACT 1: BEGINNING (Set Context)
  ↓ "Why should you care?"
ACT 2: MIDDLE (Show Problem/Opportunity)  
  ↓ "What does the data reveal?" (Use visualization here)
ACT 3: END (Propose Action)
  ↓ "What should we do next?"
```

**Example:**
- **Act 1:** "Our sales grew 15%, BUT customer retention dropped 8%"
- **Act 2:** "Analysis shows the loss concentrates in high-value customers"
- **Act 3:** "Let's implement a retention program targeting them"

## A.2: Common Mistakes to Avoid (10 mins)

**Mistake 1: Wrong Chart Type**
- ❌ Using pie charts with 10+ slices (hard to compare)
- ✅ Use bar chart instead

**Mistake 2: Truncated Axes**
- ❌ Bar chart Y-axis: 95-100% (exaggerates tiny differences)
- ✅ Start at 0; if you must truncate, clearly mark it

**Mistake 3: Too Much Color**
- ❌ Using 8+ colors in one chart (overwhelming)
- ✅ Limit to 3-5 colors max

**Mistake 4: No Story**
- ❌ Just showing a chart without explanation
- ✅ Frame data in narrative: "Here's the problem, here's what it means, here's what to do"

**Mistake 5: Forgetting Your Audience**
- ❌ Same message for executives and data scientists
- ✅ Executives care about ROI; Data scientists care about methodology

## A.3: Know Your Audience (10 mins)

**Different audiences need different messages:**

| Audience | Cares About | Your Message | Detail Level |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Executive** | ROI, decision | "Impact on business, here's the choice" | High-level only |
| **Manager** | Implementation | "This is what to do, here's the impact" | Key drivers highlighted |
| **Data Team** | Methodology | "Here's how I analyzed it" | Full technical details |
| **General Public** | Relevance, clarity | "Why it affects you, here's the key insight" | Simple, no jargon |

**Before class:** Ask yourself: "Who are we talking to? What do they care about?"

## ✅ Pre-Class Checklist (5 mins)

Before walking into class, can you answer these?

- [ ] What is pre-attentive processing? Why does it matter?
- [ ] Name 2 mistakes that make visualizations misleading
- [ ] What's the difference between a bar chart and a line chart?
- [ ] Describe the three-act storytelling structure
- [ ] How does your message change for different audiences?

**Score: 5/5?** You're ready for class. ✓

**Missed some?** Skim that section again in the next 5 minutes.

## 🎯 Why This Matters for Today's Python Lesson

In today's class:
- You'll learn **tools** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- But the **principles** you just learned are why those tools work
- When instructor adjusts colors, removes gridlines, or reorganizes plots → that's putting these principles into code
- Everything connects to what you just read

**Ready? Go to class. You've got this.** 🚀
